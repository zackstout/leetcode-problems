# Real Analysis

- Closure of a set: smallest closed set that contains a given set.
- Or: the intersection of all closed sets that contain a given set.
- Or: the union of a set with all its limit points.
- Limit point: can be "approached" by points in the set, even if not in the set.
- The closure of the rationals is the reals.

## Metric Spaces

- Include a metric that is positive-definite, symmetric, obeys triangle inequality, and where 0 implies x=y.
- A subset X is open if for every point in X, there is a ball around that point that is entirely contained in X.
- Arbitrary unions of open sets are open, but only finite intersections are open.
- A point z is a limit point for a set A if every open set U containing z intersects A in a point other than z. Huh...
- Ex: the boundary of the unit disk.
- Closed iff contains all limit points.

## Topological Spaces

- Doesn't necessarily include a metric.
- A topological space is a pair (X, T), where X is a set and T is a set of subsets of X that satisfy: closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections, includes empty set and whole set.
- We call the sets in T "open".
- If the space is metric, the "usual" topology induced by that notion of openness (from balls) is called the Euclidean topology.
- Now, say: a set is closed if its complement is open.
- With this definition, we can prove that a set is closed iff it contains all its limit points.
- Both the empty set and the total set are both open and closed (open by definition, closed by complement being open).
- Continuity: a function from X to Y is continuous iff the pre-image of any open set in Y is open in X.
- Or: a function is continous if for any neighborhood V of Y there is a neighborhood U of X such that f(U) is contained in V.
- A homeomorphism is a function that is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse.
