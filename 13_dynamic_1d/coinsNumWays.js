// Not actually in Neetcode
// But a good one, paradigmatic for DP, that I think I get.

// Say we have denominations [1, 2, 5] and we want to make 11.
// Well we need to know the number of ways to make (11-1), (11-2), and (11-5).
// That's pretty much it.
// "What if we already knew the answer to the subproblems?"

// And I think "minimum ways to make X" is a simple variation of this. You can use exact same idea.
