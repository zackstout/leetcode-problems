Yeah really enjoying these. Some of it feels like refresher/review, a lot of it is learning new tricks.

Good patterns to know for sure. Especially for stuff like AoC.

And possibly helpful for future interviews.

Also it's like... back to the earliest roots. The Edabit days lol.

Also feels good to just de-mystify this stuff that some people use to gatekeep programming.

Next up: Binary (search matrix, koko), Graph (num islands, max area, walls and gates), Math (rotate image - transpose & flip)

Chinese imperial exams lol
