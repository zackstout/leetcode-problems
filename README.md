# NeetCode 150

https://neetcode.io/practice

Yeah really enjoying these. Some of it feels like refresher/review, a lot of it is learning new tricks.

Good patterns to know for sure. Especially for stuff like AoC.

And possibly helpful for future interviews.

Also it's like... back to the earliest roots. The Edabit days lol.

Also feels good to just de-mystify this stuff that some people use to gatekeep programming.

Next up: Binary (search matrix, koko), Graph (num islands, max area, walls and gates), Math (rotate image - transpose & flip)

Chinese imperial exams lol

=====================

Linked lists -- merge two sorted lists -- url -- different approaches, complexity of each

Categories from https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/:

- array/string
- 2 pointers
- sliding window
- matrix
- hashmap
- intervals
- stack
- linked list
- binary tree
- graph
- graph bfs
- trie
- backtracking
- divide & conquer
- kadane's
- binary search
- heap
- bit manipulation
- math
- dp
- 2d dp

--- only thing missing from that is "greedy" -- i guess split into array/strings and Kadane's, ok sure
--- maaaaybe topo sort
--- spanning trees?
--- bfs? dfs?

====

-- we want some kind of "problem on left, solution on right" structure, probably.

-- we could give a 2-page thing for each idea? like 2 pointer, stack, etc? some might need more but oh well.

-- just making a start will be huge. having all that knowledge/info in one place -- that we can easily peruse -- will be enormously useful.

====

also don't sleep on AoC buddy

this could be our year

we got 2 weeks to really bulk up

get those shortcuts ready chief

ahhhhh it's really a shame we'll be in belize for 4th through 12th, the ripest part! oh well haha
