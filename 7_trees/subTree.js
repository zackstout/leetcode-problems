// Nice I get the idea.
// To check if one tree is a subtree of another,
// Recursively go through and check if current tree is same as target, OR if left or right is same as target.
// To test if "same as target" or if trees are equal, just go through recursively.

// keep in mind that "null" is a subtree of anything and nothing is a subtree of null.

// So this builds directly on the "same tree" problem.
