// This was is tricky...

// There are several variations of Water and Jug Problem.
// The problem discussed here can be modeled by means of the Diophantine equation of the form mx + ny = d
// which is solvable if and only if gcd(m, n) divides d.
// Also, the solution x,y for which equation is satisfied can be given using the Extended Euclid algorithm for GCD.

// This is the kind of thing i wish i knew lol
